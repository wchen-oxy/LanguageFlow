      <h1 class="text-center">What We Provide</h1>
      <p class="about-desc">
        We host your dictionary content in a format that can be conveniently accessed online or on your Android phone. Once your dictionary content is appropriately formatted, the data will be processsed and uploaded to a database. This database can then be accessed by you in an interface that will allow you to instantaneously create, edit and delete entries in your dictionary. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Your dictionary can then be accessed by your target audience on the web. We are currently working on the Android component and will release it soon on the Google Play Store!
        <br>
        <br>
        Most importantly, we will not be charging a fee to use this platform. However we are looking for donations and partners to help build our service, as we are still in the early stages of development.

  <h1 class="text-center">How The "The Blank Dictionary" Was Created</h1>
  <p class="about-desc desc">This project began as a simple online dictionary to promote the  language "Bhutia," also known as "Lhokay". Dr. Amy Holmes-Tagchungdarpa worked with William Chen to create a basic online dictionary for those living in Sikkim, India, as digital dictionaries for "Lhokay" did not exist. With Dr. Holmes-Tagchundarpa supervising, William built the initial dictionary project with funding from the Occidental College Religious Studies department and the Occidental Undergraduate Research Center over the 2018 summer. 
  <br>
  <br>
  With generous support from Dr. Holmes-Tagchungdarpa, William later obtained for a grant from the "Davis Projects for Peace" organization to expand the inital scope of the project. This service, "The Blank Dictionary" is the result of that expansion. Now instead of promoting just one language, "The Blank Dictionary" aims to promote all languages that are at-risk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Interested language scholars can get in contact with Dr. Holmes-Tagchungdarpa or William to create an online dictionary for their language that can be accessible on the web or as an Android app. So long as you have the appropriate dictionary content, you can quickly launch your digital language resource!
