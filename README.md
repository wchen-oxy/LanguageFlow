------------------
## Overview
### What is this? 
The "Blank Dictionary" allows non-technical users to create and maintain a dictionary that is immediately viewable on web browsers and as a mobile app (mobile app users can download dictionary data for offline use). By providing this tool, we hope to increase the availability of digital language resources to those who truly need modern reference resources but lack the technical know-how or financial means to create their own. 

### What is the Tech behind this?
We have two main components, a Django webapp that can be accessed via a web browser and an Android app for mobile users. We're using ClearDB for our MySQL instance as well as Heroku to host the website/api.

### Can I Add a New Dictionary or Maintain an Existing One?
Yes! Just reach out to us to get you set up!

### How Else Can I Get Involved?
We have **no funding**. The "Blank Dictionary" is going to rely on your help for building content, funding and to improve the platform. Please contact us if you're interested in doing so.
