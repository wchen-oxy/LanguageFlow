        \t Hello! This app is designed for people who speak endangered or at risk languages and need a
        digital dictionary for reference. Since there are so many languages out there in the world
        that need digital dictionaries, we have created one massive mega dictionary that will contain
        all these individual dictionaries. That\'s why we\'re
        calling this \"The Blank Dictionary\".
        \n\n
        \t To switch between a dictionary, just toggle between
        dictionaries in the settings. We also have a website at www.blank-dictionary.herokuapp.com
        that functions like this mobile app. (The website may take a couple seconds to load if it
        hasn\'t been used for awhile).
        \n\n
        \t If this sounds good to you, please consider supporting us. This project was never intended
        to be controlled by one person. We need your help to create content and if possible, your
        donations. We currently have no funding and are looking for different ways to sustain this
        project (There is only one person developing the software).
        \n\n
        \t If you would like to contribute content to a language already listed in here, or if you
        want to create a new dictionary for another language, feel free to email
        88developers@gmail.com to get started.
        \n\n
        \t If something isn\'t working or if you have any other questions, free free to email me as well!
